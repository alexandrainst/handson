# Deep learning course

In this workshop we will train an image classifier to predict whether a picture shows a cat or a dog.

## Focus and intended target
This workshop is intended for software developers/engineers, who are already familiar with python.
The focus of this workshop will be on establishing a broad understanding of how machine learning works and how to build a reasonable pipeline for ML training.

We will NOT focus on the math in this workshop.

We will NOT establish a full MLOps pipeline.

At the end of this workshop you should have a reasonable framework to start training your own neural networks in as well as a decent understanding of the various components that goes into training such a neural network.

## Getting started
This repository contains both jupyter notebooks as well as standard python files, and as such can be run either as notebooks or opened as a standard python project.
The notebooks and examples should be equivalent, so feel free to use whichever format you prefer.
